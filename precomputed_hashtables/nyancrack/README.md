nyancrack
=========

Nyancrack eats words and poops rainbows! (Well not yet ... it's precomputed hash tables at the moment)

nyancrack uses python's multiprocessing library, consuming a wordlist to produce hash tables, to limit memory usage it does this using a circular buffer, once the buffer becomes full, threads are spawned to process the data.

nyancrack is easily extendable by created a processing module within the lib/ folder, there is an example to get you started see lib/md5.py simply create a new module and add the import line to lib/__init__.py and you're good to go, nyancrack can now support your custom hash/processing type !

Improvements
------------

1. Animated colour nyancat progress indicator of course!
2. cuda intrgration and comparitive benchmarks
3. example hash method demonstraing salt integration
4. removal of arbitary 10000 word circular buffer in favour of run time specified memory size, i.e. -m 1024 to allocate 1gb to the buffer
5. explore a c / go port of nyancrack
6. Test on more powerful CPU

Extension
---------

I've made it so this is extreamly easy to extend.

1. create your file in the lib directory i.e. lib/my_hash_method.py
2. create a single method in the file called hash which should take a single argument
3. update lib/__init__.py to include your new file.
4. run your new method with -r my_rainbox_method.py
